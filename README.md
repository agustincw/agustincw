<h1 align="center">Hello World, I'm Agustin üëã üë®‚Äçüíª </h1>
<h3 align="center"><em>Full Stack Developer</em></h3>
<p>I entered the IT world after having done an intensive 800-hour program, which lasted four months, at the Coding Bootcamp of Plataforma 5. I am deeply interested in applying the technical knowledge acquired, using agile methodologies that foster collaborative work. I am willing to adapt myself to new technologies and team work that each project may require.</p>
